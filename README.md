# React Portfolio


App deployed at: https://scarletbowen.github.io/portfolio-react/

### Description:
>This is my personal web developer portfolio created with React. Here you can find my professional portfolio of recent projects.  On the portfolio page you can find all the information about these projects as well as their links to deployed apps, links to repos, and a screenshot of the application.   

## Technologies Used:
This is a React application made with create-react-app. The portfolio is currently only a front end application. I built a single 'project' component to dynamically render each project with the same code.  

## Usage:
Upon landing on the home page, you can see my name along with two clickable icons to my LinkedIn and GitHub accounts. The nav bar at the top will take you to my portfolio page or contact page.  The portfolio page has clickable links to take you to the application repo or deployed version.  The footer at the bottom on all pages will take you to my Github, LinkedIn or my resume.
